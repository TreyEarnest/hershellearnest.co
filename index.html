					<p>The transition from high school to college or to living life as an adult can not only be scary, it can also be a rude awakening. For most kids, high school had many upsides and few downs, until you eventually found your niche of friends. For those in sports and other arenas, you may have even been a big deal in high school.</p>
					<p>But college and university life is way different, and you may feel like you are living in a different universe. Here, no one knows your name, your past accomplishments, and the professors are indifferent whether you show up for class or not. While you were once a big fish in a small pond, you are now the tiniest fish in an ocean of people.</p>
					<p>How do you make it work? Is a large university, small college, community college, or career training the right path for you?</p>
					<p>Hershell Earnest&#39;s This Is Chess Not Checkers is here to help. With anecdotes from his own life, he provides insight for the graduating high schooler, the college freshmen student, parents, and those entering the workforce. Full of wisdom plucked from real life students from all walks of life, he gives you the real deal of how to survive and transition in these rough waters.</p>
					<p>Here&#39;s a tip from Hershell: &quot;It all begins with taking ownership of your education and how you manage your vision of yourself. If you are living life unintentional and reactionary, it’s like playing checkers; waiting for something to happen to make your next move. What if your educational/life goals were strategically planned and your decisions were calculated from the opening, middle and end of high school, how successful would you be in the transition to college or into adulthood. Remember, in life, This Is Chess Not Checkers!”</p>
